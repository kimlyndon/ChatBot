## iBooks Project

This project is the culmination of Lesson 13 QuestionBot where we built the brains to a question/answer app already in progress.  In this lesson,  Lesson 16, the app is upgraded to log in the number of questions and answers per line. A "thinking" png is utilized after a question is asked and enter is pressed. A predefined answer will then appear underneath the input.
